#                   Intro to the Tidyverse by Colleen O'Briant
#                               Koan #8: left_join
#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# In this koan, you'll learn about left_join(), which is one way to join two
# tibbles when you have variables that link them together.

# To conquer this challenge:
# 1. When facing an exercise, bravely fill in the blank and prepare for action.
# 2. Liberate the code from its comment chains (Ctrl+Shift+C on Windows,
#    Cmd+Shift+C on Macs).
# 3. Then place your cursor at the end of the last line of the chunk and command
#.   it to run in the console (Ctrl/Cmd+Return).
# 4. Preserve your progress by saving (Ctrl/Cmd+S) and verifying your answers
#.   (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+T).
# 5. Once you've achieved 100% mastery, transform your work into an html
#    treasure (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+K) and share your spoils on Canvas!

# Run this code to get started. Make sure you have an internet connection, or
# reading in data from the web will not work.

library(tidyverse)
people <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/person.csv")
drivers_license <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/drivers_license.csv")
income <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/income.csv")

#                               ----- people -----

# You have 3 new datasets in your global environment. The first one we'll work
# on is `people`. Don't worry: all the SSNs, along with all the other
# information, is made up.

# Take a look at the 'people' dataset:
people

# To find information about someone named Daniel Dumire, we can filter() on
# name:
people %>%
  filter(name == "Daniel Dumire")

# You can also use `str_detect()` to detect a character string for partial
# matches:
people %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "Daniel"))

# Read the qelp docs on str_detect:
?qelp::str_detect

# The carrot `^` means "starts with":
people %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "^Daniel"))

# The dollar sign `$` means "ends with":
people %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "nson$"))

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# 1. Query the data to find out if there's anyone with your first or last
# name using `|`, which is the logical operator for "or". If not, is there
# anyone with the first few letters of your first name, or the last few letters
# of your last name?

#1@

# people %>%
#   filter(str_detect(__, __) | str_detect(__, __))

#@1

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# 2. Use 'select()' to find Daniel Dumire's license_id.

#2@

# people %>%
#   filter(__) %>%
#   select(__)

#@2

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#                          ----- drivers_license -----
#
# 3. Now look for Daniel Dumire in the 'drivers_license' tibble.
# The problem: there's no 'name' column in that tibble. You have to search
# instead by 'id'. That is, 'license_id' in the 'people' tibble can be matched
# with 'id' in the 'drivers_license' tibble.

#3@

# drivers_license %>%
#   filter(id == __)

#@3

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#                               ----- income -----

# 4. Find a person whose name is Bennett Jimmerson and find their income.
#   You can follow the same 2-step process as 2 and 3. Which variables
#   can be matched between 'income' and 'people'? (use 'names(income)'
#   and 'names(people)' to quickly remind yourself of the variables in
#   each tibble)

#4@

# __

#@4

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#                            ----- left_join() -----
#
# A more efficient way to solve questions like 2, 3, and 4 is to join
# the tibbles by the matching variables, which are called "keys".

# We can join 'people' and 'drivers_license' by 'license_id == id':
people %>%
  left_join(drivers_license, join_by(license_id == id))

# To get a complete set of information about Daniel Dumire, I join 'people' with
# 'drivers_license' by the keys the two tibbles have in common, then filter on
# "Daniel Dumire" and select the information I'm interested in:
people %>%
  left_join(drivers_license, join_by(license_id == id)) %>%
  filter(name == "Daniel Dumire") %>%
  select(name, age, height, eye_color, hair_color, gender, car_make)

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# 5. Your turn: use left_join() to join 'people' with 'income'.
# Since the key has the same name in both tibbles ('ssn'), 'join_by(ssn)'
# will work.

#5@

# __ %>%
#   __(__, join_by(ssn))

#@5

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# 6. Copy-paste your code for (5) and add another step, querying the resulting
# tibble to find Daniel Dumire's income.

#6@

# __

#@6

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# 7. One more join problem: join 'drivers_license' with 'income'. This is tricky
# because they don't share any keys! You'll have to use 'left_join' twice and
# make use of the 'people' tibble as an intermediary.

#7@

# __

#@7

#:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Last notes about joins:

# We've been joining and then filtering, like this:
people %>%
  left_join(drivers_license, join_by(license_id == id)) %>%
  filter(name == "Daniel Dumire")

# But if you're only interested in Daniel Dumire, then you can also filter and
# then join, like this:
people %>%
  filter(name == "Daniel Dumire") %>%
  left_join(drivers_license, join_by(license_id == id))

# left_join() is one of the most useful joins, and it's the only join you'll
# need to solve the murder mystery project, but there are others. Check out the
# dplyr cheat sheet (page 2, right hand side) for more information:
# https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf

# Great work! You're one step closer to tidyverse enlightenment. Make sure to
# return to this topic to meditate on it later.
